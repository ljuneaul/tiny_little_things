# input: a filename

#             Style Rule 1: Put a space after an open parenthesis "(" and
#                           one before a close parenthesis ")".
#                           -> check if there is space between ( and )
#             Style Rule 2: Put a space before and after each operator.

# output: if there is (an) error(s), tell user where it was, what it was.
#         if there is no error, end the program and inform about other rules


# next patch: negation ('-' + num)

# Dear Stephen,

# If you are reading this by any chance, please be merciful and kindly forgive
# me that this program itself is totally against the style rule 1.
# I am using an editor named Atom at my home only for non-assignment-related
# tasks and it throws tons of red and yellow warnings filling the whole screen
# scarily when I follows that rule. I really appreciate the concept and
# totally understand why I should follow the rules. And I swear I will never
# question related this matter since I totally obey your rule in the classroom.

# Yours Sincerely,
# J

# input: a file
# processing: chop line by line
#             Style Rule 1: Put a space after an open parenthesis "(" and
#                           one before a close parenthesis ")".
#                           -> check if there is space between ( and )
#             Style Rule 2: Put a space before and after each operator.
#                           -> check if an operator is between spaces
# output: if there is (an) error(s), tell user where it was, what it was.
#         if there is no error, end the program and inform about other rules
